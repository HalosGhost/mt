A Merkle Tree toy using monocypher.
This little bag of tools is sufficient to construct Merkle Roots, and verify Merkle Proofs.

**NOTE**: This is *not* production-grade software, and I am not a cryptographer, implementing crypto nearly from-scratch.
It takes multiple short-cuts and doesn't exhaustively handle error cases.
You should *not* use this for anything serious.

Use this only as a means of learning and education!
